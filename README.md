# Hello, friend!

The purpose of this challenge is to confirm that you understand the process for developing, testing
and submitting your Python code.

Write and submit an *interactive* Python program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints how much older Python is than the user (based on a simple comparison of birth year). Python's first public release occurred in 1991. 
Something like this:

```
Please tell me your name: Guido
Please tell me your age: 16
Hello, Guido. Python is 8 years older than you are!
```
Note that the text: "Guido" and "16" are entered by the **user** running the program. The final line ("Hello...")
is generated *dynamically* when you run the program, based on the name and age that the user enters.

Please see the short [example of using ```input```](https://github.com/HHS-IntroProgramming/Standards-and-Syllabus/wiki/Introduction-to-Github-with-Runpython#input) for clues as to how you might go about writing this program. You will probably also have to understand the 
[questions](https://github.com/HHS-IntroProgramming/Standards-and-Syllabus/wiki/Introduction-to-Github-with-Runpython#questions-1)
that follow.
